	abstract = {Infectious diseases pose a persistent challenge to public health worldwide. Recent global health crises, such as the {COVID}-19 pandemic and Ebola outbreaks, have underscored the vital role of infectious disease modeling in guiding public health policy and response. Infectious disease modeling is a critical tool for society, informing risk mitigation measures, prompting timely interventions, and aiding preparedness for healthcare delivery systems. This article synthesizes the current landscape of infectious disease modeling, emphasizing the integration of statistical methods in understanding and predicting the spread of infectious diseases. We begin by examining the historical context and the foundational models that have shaped the field, such as the {SIR} (susceptible, infectious, recovered) and {SEIR} (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) models. Subsequently, we delve into the methodological innovations that have arisen, including stochastic modeling, network-based approaches, and the use of big data analytics. We also explore the integration of machine learning techniques in enhancing model accuracy and responsiveness. The review identifies the challenges of parameter estimation, model validation, and the incorporation of real-time data streams. Moreover, we discuss the ethical implications of modeling, such as privacy concerns and the communication of risk. The article concludes by discussing future directions for research, highlighting the need for data integration and interdisciplinary collaboration for advancing infectious disease modeling.},

The argument is made without prejudice to the substantive heterogeneity of the discipline.},

	abstract = {As countries in the world review interventions for containing the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19), important lessons can be drawn from the study of the full transmission dynamics of its causative agent—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2)— in Wuhan (China), where vigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local outbreak of this disease1. Here we use a modelling approach to reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of {COVID}-19 in Wuhan between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583 laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8 March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40–3.67) in the early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) and Middle East respiratory syndrome ({MERS})4,5. We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23–0.33) and—by projection—reducing the total infections in Wuhan by 96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14 consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and 53\% unascertained cases, respectively—highlighting the risk posed by substantial covert infections when changing control measures. These results have important implications when considering strategies of continuing surveillance and interventions to eventually contain outbreaks of {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the exact analytical solution of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered ({SIR}) epidemic model is obtained in a parametric form. By using the exact solution we investigate some explicit models corresponding to fixed values of the parameters, and show that the numerical solution reproduces exactly the analytical solution. We also show that the generalization of the {SIR} model, including births and deaths, described by a nonlinear system of differential equations, can be reduced to an Abel type equation. The reduction of the complex {SIR} model with vital dynamics to an Abel type equation can greatly simplify the analysis of its properties. The general solution of the Abel equation is obtained by using a perturbative approach, in a power series form, and it is shown that the general solution of the {SIR} model with vital dynamics can be represented in an exact parametric form.},
